## Installation

Clone the repository and install the package using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/c-onfused69/pycalc.git
cd pycalc

```

## Usage

After installation, launch the calculator GUI from the command line:

```bash
pycalc
```

This will open the PyCalc graphical interface where you can perform calculations using the buttons.

## Development

The source code is organized under the `src/pycalc` directory:

- `calculator.py`: Core calculation logic and expression evaluation
- `gui.py`: Tkinter-based graphical user interface implementation
- `__main__.py`: Entry point to launch the GUI application

To run the application directly without installation, use:

```bash
python -m pycalc
```

## Testing
